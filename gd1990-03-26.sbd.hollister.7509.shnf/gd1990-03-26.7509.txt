Comments :
The FC/DD2496 refers to the A/D transfer.  The FC is a Flying Calf external 
24-bit A/D converter.  This provided the A/D conversion (@ 44.1KHz) which was 
then fed into my Delta DiO 2496 soundcard.  Minor Editing done in Sound Forge
Transfer and Mastering by David Hollister
SHN Conversion by Brian Voelz
